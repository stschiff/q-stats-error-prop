  abstract = "Comparisons of chromosome X and the autosomes can illuminate
              differences in the histories of males and females as well as shed
              light on the forces of natural selection. We compared the
              patterns of variation in these parts of the genome using two
              datasets that we assembled for this study that are both genomic
              in scale. Three independent analyses show that around the time of
              the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, chromosome X
              experienced much more genetic drift than is expected from the
              pattern on the autosomes. This is not predicted by known episodes
              of demographic history, and we found no similar patterns
              associated with the dispersals into East Asia and Europe. We
              conclude that a sex-biased process that reduced the female
              effective population size, or an episode of natural selection
              unusually affecting chromosome X, was associated with the
              founding of non-African populations.",
